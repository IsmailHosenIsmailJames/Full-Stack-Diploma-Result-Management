# FullStack Diploma Result Management System
This project represents a significant milestone in my practical experience in Web Development and Design. As part of my coursework, I took on the challenge of building a comprehensive Diploma Result Management System, handling both the frontend and backend development.

For the frontend, I chose to use Flutter, leveraging my background and expertise in app development to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. Flutter's cross-platform capabilities allowed me to ensure that the application is accessible and performs well across different devices.

On the backend, I utilized Python with its powerful FastAPI framework. FastAPI was selected for its high performance and ease of use, making it ideal for building a robust and scalable backend system. After developing the backend, I deployed it on render.com, ensuring that the system is accessible, secure, and reliable.

Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in full-stack development, effectively integrating the frontend with the backend, and ensuring smooth communication between the two. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced my understanding of end-to-end web application development.
